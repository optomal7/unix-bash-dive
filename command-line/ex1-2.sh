#!/bin/sh
#Write a command that prints out the string “hello, world”. Extra credit: As in Listing 1, do it two different ways, both with and without using quotation marks.

echo hello, world

#Type the command echo ’hello (with a mismatched single quote), and then get out of trouble using the technique from Box 4.

#echo 'hello, world

#^C, this doesn't translate very well with scripting, my linter is also writing me hate mail now because of it.

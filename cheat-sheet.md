^C -emergency ripcord, I sometimes have trouble remembering how to cancel something.
^A -ammend mistake, gets back to the start of the line without extraneous keys
^E -end of the line, kinda like ^A but the opposite
^U -dun goofed, start over
^L -clear your plate, like ^U but for the whole terminal, which is good because I turned off the limits of how many lines iterm remembers and can't figure out how to switch back yet. My RAM will thank me for for this.
^D -bug out, immediately close terminal. Perfect for those days you expect the FBI or NSA to barge down the door.

\> -redirect output
\>\> -ammend to file
echo - helpful way to test certain things, also just prints to the screen.
chmod 755 <./file> -gives executable access to file
history | grep <cmd I am looking for> -typically so I can find all those git gymnastics the SEP did last week.
cd - :moves to the last directory I was in
. -refers to the current directory, I always forget I can do this.

While in less

G -End of file
1G -beginning of file
/<string> -find <string> in file
